# Windows PE Basic Enhanced
Windows PE Basic Enhanced is a portable Windows recovery, deployment, troubleshooting and diagnostic tool that is based from Windows 11 PE version 24H2 (Windows ADK May 2024). <br>
It is inspired by my other project which is Windows PE Basic that is located on https://github.com/thedoggybrad/WindowsPEBasic/.

## Additional Custom Tools
It contains the following set of custom tools, I personally added that are useful for troubleshooting, diagnostic and recovery:
<br>
•cpuz.exd - CPUID CPU-Z<br>
•DiskInfo.exe - Crystal Disk Info<br>
•DiskView.exe - SysInternals DiskView<br>
•explorer.exe - Explorer++ (Not Windows Explorer)<br>
•HWMonitor.exe - CPUID Hardware Monitor<br>
•procexp.exe - SysInternals Process Explorer<br>
•procmon.exe - SysInternals Process Monitor<br>
•RAMMap.exe - SysInternals RAM Map <br>

## Tools and Commands from Windows PE
Plus all of the built-in tools and commands from Windows PE that compose of selected Windows NT tools such as Notepad, Registry Editor, SFC, DISM, BCDBOOT,  DIR, DISKPART, CHKDSK, MD, CD and more.<br>
Some familar commands from Windows NT such as SHUTDOWN (use exit instead)are not available.
