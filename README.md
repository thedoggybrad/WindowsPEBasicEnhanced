# Windows PE Basic Enhanced
Windows PE Basic Enhanced is a portable Windows recovery, deployment, troubleshooting and diagnostic tool that is based from Windows 11 PE version 24H2 (Windows ADK May 2024). <br>
It is inspired by my other project which is Windows PE Basic that is located on https://github.com/thedoggybrad/WindowsPEBasic/.

## Minimum System Requirements
‚Ä¢Storage: 400MB of FAT/FAT32/NTFS Bootable Storage<br>
‚Ä¢Memory: 512MB<br>
‚Ä¢CPU: Any 64-bit capable processor<br>
‚Ä¢GPU: None (Just a video output is needed)<br>
‚Ä¢BIOS: Legacy BIOS or UEFI BIOS

## Preferred System Configuration (For Optimal Performance)
‚Ä¢Storage: 512MB of NTFS Bootable Storage or higher capacity<br>
‚Ä¢Memory: 1GB or higher<br>
‚Ä¢CPU: A dual-core 64-bit capable processor or better<br>
‚Ä¢GPU: On-board Integrated Graphics or better<br>
‚Ä¢BIOS: Legacy BIOS or UEFI BIOS

## Additional Custom Tools
It contains the following set of custom tools, I personally added that are useful for troubleshooting, diagnostic and recovery:
<br>
‚Ä¢cpuz.exe - CPUID CPU-Z<br>
‚Ä¢DiskInfo.exe - Crystal Disk Info<br>
‚Ä¢DiskView.exe - SysInternals DiskView<br>
‚Ä¢explorer.exe - Explorer++ (Not Windows Explorer)<br>
‚Ä¢HWMonitor.exe - CPUID Hardware Monitor<br>
‚Ä¢procexp.exe - SysInternals Process Explorer<br>
‚Ä¢procmon.exe - SysInternals Process Monitor<br>
‚Ä¢RAMMap.exe - SysInternals RAM Map <br>

## Tools and Commands from Windows PE
Plus all of the built-in tools and commands from Windows PE that compose of selected Windows NT tools such as Notepad, Registry Editor, Task Manager, SFC, DISM, BCDBOOT,  DIR, DISKPART, CHKDSK, MD, CD and more.<br>
Some familar commands from Windows NT such as SHUTDOWN and more are not available (Research about commands and tools available on Windows PE).

## Basic Operation
1.) To Restart your PC, type "exit" on the Command Prompt window and hit ENTER. Shutdown is not supported.
<br>
2.) The UI is commandline, so to access GUI/Non-GUI apps you need to type the exact application name in the Command Prompt window. For my custom tools, just refer to the ".exe" titles and for built-in Windows PE tools and commands be sure to research or memorize it.

## Steps to replicate it yourself
1.) Download Install the May 2024 Windows ADK and Windows PE add-on from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install/. <br>
2.) Open Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment with Administrator Privileges (Run as Administrator).<br>
3.) Run these commands:
`copype amd64 c:\winpe`
`Dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:"c:\winpe\media\sources\boot.wim" /index:1 /MountDir:"c:\winpe\mount"`<br>
4.) Change the wallpaper at c:\winpe\mount\windows\system32\winpe.jpg. Make sure to change the owner from TrustedInstaller to your username before doing so. Use this exact wallpaper https://github.com/thedoggybrad/Windows-11-22H2-Web-Folder/blob/main/Web/Wallpaper/Windows/img19.jpg so that it will look like the same as this project.<br>
5.) Add all the following apps to the c:\winpe\mount\windows\system32\ and make sure to use the AMD64 (x64) versions of those apps.<br>
‚Ä¢cpuz.exe - CPUID CPU-Z<br>
‚Ä¢DiskInfo.exe - Crystal Disk Info<br>
‚Ä¢DiskView.exe - SysInternals DiskView<br>
‚Ä¢explorer.exe - Explorer++ (Not Windows Explorer)<br>
‚Ä¢HWMonitor.exe - CPUID Hardware Monitor<br>
‚Ä¢procexp.exe - SysInternals Process Explorer<br>
‚Ä¢procmon.exe - SysInternals Process Monitor<br>
‚Ä¢RAMMap.exe - SysInternals RAM Map <br>
Use the same filenames as the following to achieve what this project offers.
